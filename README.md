# ABK-Decomp

This GitHub repository is dedicated to the decompilation of ABK (Karting).
The project is currently in its very early stages.

# Introduction

ABK is built on the XGS (Exient Game Engine), which presents significant obstacles to modding.

Currently, it is not possible to add new content, such as UI elements, characters, or karts.
This limitation leaves the game in a state where modding is minimal, restricted to value tweaks and texture changes. As a result, the gameâ€™s appeal diminishes over time, potentially causing it to fall into obscurity.

Once players complete the game, their options are limited to racing or unlocking all karts, leaving little room for extended replayability.

Adding to the challenge is the fact that the game is only available as a 32-bit version on Android, with no 64-bit version available. (Other than iOS)

The primary goal of this decompilation project is to overcome these barriers and open up new modding possibilities, such as adding fresh content and features to breathe new life into the game.

# Decompilation
The decompilation of ABK Karting (Windows Phone version 1.8.7) focuses on the Windows Phone 8 ARM version of the game. This version is considered the best to use for decompilation due being based for windows phone (Unlike iOS which uses iOS specific frameworks , or android that uses Android specific ones , windows phone is easiest to work with), making it easier to work with compared to other platforms.

Target Version: The project specifically targets ABK Karting v1.8.7, running on Windows Phone 8 ARM.

Why This Version: The Windows Phone 8 ARM version is the most accessible and efficient version for decompilation

Current Progress: The decompilation process is in its early stages, with progress being made through the use of tools like IDA to disassemble the binary. Extracting game assets and code is ongoing.

Future Goals: The goal is to fully decompile the game and unlock modding capabilities, allowing for the addition of new content, such as characters, tracks, and gameplay features, ultimately enhancing replayability.
