# ABK-Decomp

This GitHub repository is dedicated to the decompilation of ABK (Karting).
The project is currently in its very early stages.

# Introduction

ABK is built on the XGS (Exient Game Engine), which presents significant obstacles to modding.

Currently, it is not possible to add new content, such as UI elements, characters, or karts.
This limitation leaves the game in a state where modding is minimal, restricted to value tweaks and texture changes. As a result, the gameâ€™s appeal diminishes over time, potentially causing it to fall into obscurity.

Once players complete the game, their options are limited to racing or unlocking all karts, leaving little room for extended replayability.

Adding to the challenge is the fact that the game is only available as a 32-bit version on Android, with no 64-bit version available. (Other than iOS)

The primary goal of this decompilation project is to overcome these barriers and open up new modding possibilities, such as adding fresh content and features to breathe new life into the game.
